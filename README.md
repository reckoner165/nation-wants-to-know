Nation Wants To Know is a two-part process music composition by Reckoner.

The title comes from a phrase popularized by Arnab Goswami, an Indian journalist most noted for his opinionated reporting, uncritical reproduction of government narratives and the occasional muzzling of dissent using performative rhetorics.

Using live coding to trigger samples from a variety of his television appearances, Nation Wants To Know attempts to capture the sonic squalor that has made its way into living rooms since the advent of 24 hour cable news.

Drawing directly from the early works of Steve Reich, Part I explores the afflictions in the phrase as vocalized by Goswami during one of the many appearances as an anchor. Part II uses excerpts from his shouting matches on television debates, and scattered using variable delay and stereo phasing to emphasize the anxiety resulting from a din of raised voices, while also rendering any subject matter as indecipherable.
